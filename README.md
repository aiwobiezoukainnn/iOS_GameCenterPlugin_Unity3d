# iOS_GameCenterPlugin_Unity3d

Unity3d provide SocialPlatform API interface for Cross platform gamecenter. </br>
</br>This is very simple example of iOS gamecenter for Unity3d with the help of native API. Here is a basic idea of the plugin.
First we need to authonicate Local player of social platform. Once this is done we can report Leaderboard score and Achievement progress by following its unique ID.
</br> Unity gave the ShowIU() method for both Achievement and Leaderboard which is very usefull to show the native UI. Please go through the plugin you can understand the whole technique.
Thank you
